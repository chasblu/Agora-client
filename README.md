### Inspiration  for the project
Our team decided creating a forum would be a great start for something we can build on along the way with each other. We wanted to be able to implement the backend ourselves and be able to extract data of our own. We thought it would be a great way to understand the backend and the front end and have them work asynchronously.

## Wireframing of the components

### Complications during the project
We had encountered some difficulties with the page not updating the newly created forum, post or the edited version. Ultimately, we had to useHistory to go back to the page and also use the original function to have the useEffect rerendered with the new updated information. We also had encountered some bugs with the post data, we were not able to directly use a get route to display all posts since the post information is a sub-document of the forum, so we had to use a show route to display the version of the post we would like to edit.


## Technologies Used.
1. Javascript
2. React
3. CSS- grid
4. React-router-dom


## Getting started.
1.Fork 
2. Clone down the repo.
3. Once itâ€™s in your remote repository, cd into the file (make sure you're in the react file). Install dependencies.
4. Yarn add react-router-dom.
5. Once you have the dependencies on the forked and clone version in your remote repository, run Yarn start. 
 -If you notice, your package.json file should have all the dependencies and their versions listed under the dependencies.
 -Another thing you can notice is that  your file should have a yarn.lock, and  the node modules. 
 -You should be set to go after these.
